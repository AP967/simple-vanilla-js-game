# simple-vanilla-js-game
Hello guys..!
Recently i made this game using simple vanilla javaSript, HTML and a little bit of CSS. I used lots of classes in this. And this project is coded using object oriented programming style. And i learned this from freecodecamp.org on youtube. If you have not seen their channel before i suggest you should.Although when you will see this video you will know that this game is incomplete and bricks are missing, i am still working on it, but i wanted something more better and different so i put it here on github. and i am looking forward for better ideas from you guys.
Thank You for reading this whole description.
